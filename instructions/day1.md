## Day 1
### In-class exercise
- Add a new filter to the petList component :
    - it will have 2 arguments : property name and property value
    - bind the pipe to the list the ngFor is using and hard code the property name argument to 'awake', use class member for the property value argument  
    - add a control component to set the value property via a checkbox (true/false)
    - check you can filter awake/asleep pets
### Homework
   - Clone this repo and play with the samples, specifically with those in day1-2
